# Time-Error-Correction-D
This code is for a project to correct misreported observation times in data assimilation. 
This branch is intended to test a change to the infrastructure of the code (but not to its functionality).
I am combining the knownErrorNormalLikelihood and randomNormalLikelihood methods in order to be more concise.
