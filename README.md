# Time-Error-Correction-D
A project to correct misreported observation times in data assimilation
This is the DEPRECATED branch!
It uses Vectors that are hardcoded to have 3 dimensions, and conflict with d2d-style vectors.
The master branch has already been updated to have variable dimensionality (see dimensionality branch). When three dimensions are used in master, the results are exactly the same as a standard model run on this branch, so this code is obsolete. 
I am keeping it here for posteriority and to have backup code.
